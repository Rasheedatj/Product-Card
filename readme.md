# An Animated Product card
### This is an animated produvt card that displays the details of the product when you hover on a container.

# Process
I started out givivng the body a background gradient to create that effect of sliced colors, gave the body a display of flex and then I centered the contents of the body using justify content and align-items. 

I created the first container which has the image of the product and the details container that is hidden by default all under one container which has a display of relative. 

I gave the hidden container a position of absolute and positioned it beneath the other box appropriately. Other css properties that i used were transition, transform, z-ndex e.t.c
